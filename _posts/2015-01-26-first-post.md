<p>I know there are many personal blogs out there, more then anyone can read in a lifetime. I’d like to think one writes his blog more like a diary, i never had a diary. Something i do regret sometimes; i can imagine it’s nice to read back stuff you experienced days, week or even years ago. I don’t know if i have the perseverance to keep filling this blog, but i like the challenge and think it would be fun to actual start one.</p>
<p>I hope i like to read my stories again someday and of course the occasional visitor that is browsing the internet and passes my website ; thank you!</p>
