<strong>Google places a malware warning on site</strong>
<p>Last month i experienced a malware-infection in a Wordpress website. The domain where the website was hosted on is used for different purposes, a main website, support-website on subdomain and web-app on another subdomain. The malware was detected in the main website. The direct origin of the malware wasn’t found but it was probably added though a security breach in one of the wordpress-plugins the website was using. Unfortunately Google was the first to notice the hack and labelled the domain with the malware detection. Google does this by putting a full red screen with a malware-detection notice in front of the website. Not good for any visitor experience; it's scary.</p>
<p>Although only the main site was infected; Google labelled the domain with a wildcard so basically the total domain was flagged. I personally think it is a little bit of a drastic method because you also scare visitors an a safe-subdomain; i can understand the practice though. As a website owner you are obligated to maintain a safe environment for you visitors; if you fail will you get penalized.</p>
<strong>How to get rid of the malware warning</strong>
<p>There is little information about what you need to do in case of a malware infection so i will write what we did. We immediately deleted the infected website so our server was clean again. Then we notified Google that there's no malware on the site. The best way to ask a review by Google is through the webmaster tools; I recommended that you setup an account when you do not have one already.</p>
<p>It will take Google on average 10 hours to review to website on malware before they remove to notification from your domain.  <a href="http://www.sucuri.net">Securly</a>, the web-service for website protection, measured google’s timing and they state the fasted check was done within 5 hours and the slowest response was up to 13 hours.</p>
<strong>Other options to remove the warning</strong>
<p>If there is no Webmaster Tools account available you can also try to ask for a review by www.stopbadware.org. They review every request manually, could take several days, so i would suggest you go with the webmaster tools or set one up right away.</p>
<strong>Prevent it from happening again</strong>
<p>Be sure to try to find the source of the malware so set new password on the FTP and website as google holds the domain in quarantine for about 3 months.</p>
